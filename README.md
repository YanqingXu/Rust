## About

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It's known for its powerful type system, memory safety, and modern tooling. This repository is my personal space to explore Rust's features, best practices, and ecosystem.

## Learning Resources

Here are some of the resources I'm using to learn Rust:

- **Books:**
  - [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (The Rust Book)
  - [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
  - [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/)

- **Online Courses:**
  - [Rust Programming Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsocPEZBd-M) (YouTube)
  - [Rust Fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-fundamentals/) (Udemy)

- **Community:**
  - [Rust Users Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/)
  - [Rust Discord](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

- **Documentation:**
  - [Rust Standard Library Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/)
  - [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)

## Projects

This section will be updated as I complete more projects. Here are a few that I'm currently working on:

1. **CLI Tool**: A simple command-line tool to manage tasks.
2. **Web Server**: A basic HTTP server using the `hyper` crate.
3. **Concurrency Example**: A project demonstrating Rust's concurrency model.

Each project will have its own directory with a README explaining the project's purpose, how to run it, and what I learned from it.
